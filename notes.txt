Mongo DB
- NoSQL Database that allows us to store data in collections and documents

Collection
- A collection of related items (documents) that we wish to store

Document
- An individual record in a collection
- A JavaScript Object (stored in JSON format)

We would have a collection of fruits
Each fruit object would be represented by a document
const fruits = [
  {
    name: 'apple', // String, required
    color: 'red', // String, required
    readyToEat: true // Boolean
  },
  {
    name: 'watermelon',
    color: 'green',
    readyToEat: true
  },
  {
    name: undefined,
    color: undefined
  }
]

Mongoose
- ODM (Object Document Mapper)
- The translator between our Express App and MongoDB

What Does Mongoose Do For Us?
- Create a connection to our Database
- Validate our data - making sure all of our data has the same structure and follows certain rules
